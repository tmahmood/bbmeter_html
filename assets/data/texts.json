			"content": "<b>Democratic Participation and Reform</b><p>Project Duration: April, 2011 - April, 2016</p><p>In Bangladesh, Democracy International is implementing the Democratic Participation and Reform Program, a USAID-funded political party development program designed to <ul><li>enhance grassroots participation with a focus on women and youth</li><li>improve the parties’ access to and use of information, and <li>improve the environment for responsive politics.</li></ul></p><b>ENHANCING GRASSROOTS PARTICIPATION</b><p>To increase the political engagement of women and youth in political parties and in national political activity, DI has established regional women and youth centers in each of the seven regions of Bangladesh, with offices located in the cities of Barisal, Bogra, Chittagong, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rangpur, and Sylhet. From these offices DI has conducted awareness campaigns, including town hall meetings and women’s dialogues, to inform women and youth on ways to participate in political process. We are also currently implementing a micro-activities funding mechanism to help encourage innovative, youth- and women-focused projects designed by grassroots groups. Lastly, DI is managing a fellowship program for young political party activists that provides training and capacity building for selected fellows and gives them the opportunity to engage with national and regional party leaders on important political and policy issues. The fellowship program focuses on several different areas of political party operations, including connecting with young people, outreach to women, media relations, and using technology to improve party operations.</p><b>IMPROVING INFORMATION ACCESS AND UTILIZATION</b><p>To strengthen the capacity of political parties to conduct and utilize research, DI is leading a series of activities to demonstrate the value of public opinion research, develop effective polling and research approaches, and incorporate research findings into policy information and communication strategies. Specific activities include an applied research program, including focus group discussions with regional and national surveys; a targeted research training program; and a planned expansion of the training program following elections in 2013.</p><b>IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS</b><p>To improve and facilitate coordination on reform initiatives between national party organizations and historically marginalized political groups, particularly women and youth, DI is engaging parties in more sophisticated and strategic constituency outreach. Specific activities include a national conference series, the creation of party web portals, and the funding of specific series party requests for technical assistance. DI works with a variety of local partners across the country to ensure maximum impact.</p>",
